 
Java – Boarding Pass Ticket

Project Overview
This project involves generating a boarding pass ticket and storing it in a file. 
The application should take the passenger details as input. The details of the boarding pass are to be stored in a file. The details should include valid data such as: name, email, phone number, gender, age, boarding pass number, date, origin, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), departure time. 
The application should generate a boarding pass ticket using the boarding pass details. The generated ticket should contain the following information: 
•	Boarding Pass Number, Date, Origin, Destination, Estimated time of arrival (ETA), Departure Time
•	Name, Email, Phone Number, Gender, Age
•	Total Ticket Price

Business Requirements
•	The user will be required to enter their Name, Email, Phone Number, Gender, Age, Date, Destination, and Departure Time into the console or GUI (teams’ preference). 
•	From the input the computer must generate the ETA and Ticket Price.
•	The computer must generate the boarding pass number ensuring the number is unique. 
•	All generated data as well as the data acquired from the user input must be stored in a file. 
•	Using the data in the file write the ticket to a new file in a user-friendly format (team’s preference). 
•	Make sure you test your code. 
•	Ticket Price should be calculated as follows:
	Age < = 12, 50% reduction of ticket price regardless of gender  
	Age > = 60, 60% reduction of ticket price regardless of gender 
	Females, 25% discount on the ticket price

Required Technologies:
•	Git
•	Java
•	GitHub
•	JUnit
Optional Technologies:
•	GUI Library 
•	Formatting Library (Date, Time, ETC)
